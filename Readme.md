## EE569 Digital Image Processing

This course focus on non-deep learning image processing, including lots of classic algorithms, some of which are used by Opencv. However it also contains deep learning parts like neural networks and PixelHop, a research achievement from our professor.

Most of the coding are in C++, plus some python and Matlab. By implementing the algorithms from scratch and computing from pixel to pixel, we gained knowledge really in depth. All the projects reports are gathered in **/reports** folder. Please have a look.
